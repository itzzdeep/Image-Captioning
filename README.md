# Image-Captioning

Image captioning is a topic that combines LSTM text generation with the computer vision powers of a convolutional neural network. It is well researched by Andrej Karpathy, now Sr. Director of AI at Tesla I saw this on a deep learning lacture of Stanford.Here we will implement a basic image captioning model.It will not be perfect as we are taking a much smaller dataset for training but it will give decent captions.
