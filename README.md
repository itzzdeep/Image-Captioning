# Image-Captioning

Image captioning is a topic that combines NLP with the computer vision powers of a convolutional neural network. It is well researched by Andrej Karpathy, now leads the computer vision team at Tesla I saw this on a deep learning lacture of Stanford.Here we will implement a basic image captioning model.It will not be perfect as we are taking a much smaller dataset for training but it will give decent captions.

Here I have used a approach that combines LSTM test genaration and power of CNN. You can have a look at the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).

Now many other approches are there that combines with Transformer archtitechture and attention mechanism. Such approch is completely implemented at Tensorflow tutorials. Check out the implementation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning).
